# Python Fundamentals Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Fundamentals Tutorial.

In this tutorial, we shall be learning about the following data structures in Python:

- [Queues](1-queues.md)
- [Linkedlists](2-linkedlists.md)
- [Trees](3-trees.md)

Each module will adopt a step-by-step approach towards learning. They are like building blocks that we assist you in gaining a firm understanding of each topic and its elements. Each module will also contain examples and provide you exercises at its end to practice your knowledge. Make a good effort to solve the exercises before comparing your solution with the solution provided. Try not to look at the solution before completing each exercise.

## Scope of this Tutorial

It is important to state that no tutorial, textbook, or course can teach a student all there is to know about a particular topic. They only serve as providing knowledge and insights to help the student embark on the a path of self-continuous learning and self-improvement. Furthermore, knowledge is not static but continuously changing. Therefore, the student has the responsibility to upgrade and update his or her knowledge on any subject progressively.

This tutorial also assumes that you already have Python installed on your laptop and that you have a basic understanding of writing codes in Python. You are encouraged to practice along in your Python code editor or IDE (such as Visual Studio Code) as you go along in this tutorial.

## Data Structures: Definition, Uses, and General Characteristics

Before we go into our topics for this tutorial, let us have a brief dicussion about Data Structures.

### Definition: What are Data Structures?

To define the subject, let us begin by separating it into its two constituent words: **Data** and **Structures**

#### Data

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) defines _data_ as "_a collection of discrete or continuous values that convey information, describing the quantity, quality, fact, statistics, other basic units of meaning, or simply sequences of symbols that may be further interpreted formally_." Let's reduce that to a simple definition:

    Data is facts and statistics collected together for storage, reference or analysis.

#### Structures

Data comes in many types - strings, integers, booleans, dates, and many more. Think of a data structure as the "container" in which you would keep a particular data or a set of data, a systematci way to organize, store, access, and manage it efficiently. This concept will become clearer as we proceed in this tutorial.

## Glossary of Terms

- Algorithm - A finite collection of well-defined steps designed to solve a particular problem.
- Complexity - The time, space, and resources that an algorithm requies to run.
- Direct or Random Access - An Element in the data structure can be accessed in constant time, regardless of the structure's size and the position of the element in the structure.
- Dynamic data - Data that its physical size and memory size requirements change.
- Heterogenous data - These are data structures in which its members or elements can be of different data types.
- Homogenous data structures - These are data structures in which all its members or elements are the same data type.
- Immutable - Data or elements cannot be changed after it is created.
- Linear data - Data whose elements are in a linear sequence, in other words, they are arranged in a specified order
- Mutable - Data or elements can be changed after it is created.
- Non-linear data - Data whose elements are not in any specified order.
- Sequential or Serial Access - The elements of the structure can be accessed in one particular order.
- Static data - Data for which its physical size and memory size requirements is fixed and cannot be changed.
